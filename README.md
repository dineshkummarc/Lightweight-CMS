# Lightweight-CMS
Lightweight CMS for running website, gallery, blog or forums


## About

I started writing this content management system as a hobby project when I was still in highschool with intention to improve my programming skills and to have CMS for personal use. Currently I am using this CMS to run my photo gallery. Currently this CMS is suitable for small sites and at the moment may not be the best option for medium to large sites. This repository is created to simplify the development process of this CMS. You can use this software to run your website, gallery, blog or forum at your own risk.
